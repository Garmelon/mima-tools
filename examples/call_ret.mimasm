; This CALL/RET example does not use any sort of stack, and thus can
; only go 1 call deep. Nevertheless, it demonstrates how the CALL and
; RET instructions behave.

main:
  LDC 0
  ADC 1
  CALL sub ; Sets the RA to the next address (in this case, ADC 4)
  ADC 4
  HALT

sub:
  ADC 50
  RET ; Jumps to the ADC 4
